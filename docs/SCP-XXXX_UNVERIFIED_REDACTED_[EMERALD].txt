**Description:**  
SCP-XXXX is a crystalline tablet discovered beneath a collapsed monastic ruin in Al-Minya, Egypt. The object emits low-level phosphorescence and is inscribed with overlaid texts in Syriac, Koine Greek, and a third unknown language.  

Exposure beyond 30 seconds induces:  
- Temporal disassociation  
- Glyph reproduction compulsion  
- Vocal repetition of Hermetic phrases  
- Recursive ideation loops centered on "transmutation"  

[Margin note — graphite, left side:]  
> The voice said it was “returning me to symmetry.” Not metaphor. Not metaphor.

[Margin note — red ink, near bottom:]  
> DO NOT attempt phonetic reconstruction. Voice-to-glyph encoding is unstable.

Recovered from sealed catacombs beneath GOC-occupied dig site. All seven GOC agents deceased. Glyphs were found etched onto their skin.

**Status:**  
Analyst ARV-89 assigned to translation efforts. Analyst currently unaccounted for.
