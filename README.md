# emerald-salvage-alpha
Recovered Site-73 fragments. SCP-XXXX entry partial. Glyphic recursion event suspected
# emerald-salvage-alpha

Found this while running comparative text structure scans across archived SCP backups flagged for glyphic noise. I shouldn’t have had access. These weren't supposed to be recoverable. Site-73’s Theta sublevel was believed to be a total loss, scrubbed post-event. But not everything was purged.

The files were fragmentary—split across corrupted sectors, buried in data shadows left by the rollback protocol. What I could recompile is stored here.

There’s a name buried in the metadata: **ARV-89**.  
An archivist, maybe. Or something else.  
They left behind more than notes.

Inside this repository you’ll find:

### `/docs`
- **SCP-XXXX_UNVERIFIED_REDACTED_[EMERALD].pdf**  
  A partial SCP Foundation draft—clearly internal, unsigned, unapproved. The formatting collapses halfway through. There's handwriting in the margins I can’t trace to any known analyst.

- **changelog_manifest.txt**  
  Auto-compiled by a dead process. File paths don’t match standard directory trees. Some logs reference future timestamps.

---

### `/logs`
- **73-Vault-D-hallway.log**  
  Surveillance transcript. Timestamp inconsistencies. A shadow enters and exits the same frame three times within one second.

- **73theta-internal-feed_notes.txt**  
  Voice-to-text scrapings from internal observer nodes. Repeating glyphs. Mirrored alerts. One line repeats: *"you are being returned to symmetry."*

---

### `/images`
- **Note_Page_03.jpg**  
  A journal page. If you know Syriac, the syntax is… off. The lower glyph matches something carved into the wall in the footage log. Look closely at the bottom-right ink smear.

- **glyph_wall_fragment.jpg**  
  Surveillance still, adjusted to IR spectrum. Concentric glyph rings. Check the EXIF data for something I couldn't decrypt.

---

### `/audio`
- **whisper_reverse.wav**  
  12 seconds. Sounds like wind at first. Run it backwards. Then listen again, slowed to 80%. Someone’s reciting something—**not quite Latin.**

---

### 🔐 `.vitriol_key`
Encrypted zip. 64MB. I don't know what’s in it.

The filename appears 37 times in the 73theta log, but it was always followed by the phrase:  
**“Only the dissolving can return.”**

I haven’t opened it. Maybe you can.

## ❗ Suggested Exploration Order

1. Start with the PDF: `docs/SCP-XXXX_UNVERIFIED_REDACTED_[EMERALD].pdf`
2. Then check the journal fragment: `images/Note_Page_03.jpg`
3. Listen to the whisper file (in reverse)
4. Review `logs/73-Vault-D-hallway.log`
5. Attempt decryption of `.vitriol_key` (see clues in glyph metadata)

## 🧬 Warning

If the glyphs start repeating in your dreams, stop reading.  
If the number **3:33** starts showing up on your system clock more than twice, pull power.  
If you hear the voice again while awake, it’s already inside the recursion.

This repo will stay live as long as I do.  
I won’t update it again. I think I’ve already gone too far.  
The Tablet doesn’t want to be translated. It wants to be remembered.
